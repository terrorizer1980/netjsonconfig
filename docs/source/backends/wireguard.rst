Wireguard Backend
=================

.. include:: ../_github.rst

The ``Wireguard`` backend allows to generate Wireguard compatible configurations.

This backend is designed to allow updating the configuration of a wireguard peer
automatically when the configuration of a VPN server is changed in OpenWISP, or
when a new peer is added to OpenWISP (a new device with wireguard VPN client template).
